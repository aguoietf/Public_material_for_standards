Thank you xxx, and good morning everyone, my talk for today is about end-to-end mgt&ctrl for transport and access networks. 

Two parts for my talk, first part is an overview about end-to-end M&C, and second part will talk about standardization updates on the data modeling to realize end-to-end M&C.

End-to-end management and control is a key component towards automous networking. It brings resources from different network segments under the same management umbrella so that closed-loop automation can be built on on top of it from end-to-end.

Bringing transport and access under the same control has been considered challenging, because both access and transport networks are typcially managed as silos of managment domains , and there are usually administrative boundaries and less software interactions in between. The networks themselves are complex in nature, built with multi-technologies, by multiple vendor systems, and are organized into multi-domain and multi-layer.

New technologies such as SDN control with open interfaces make it possible to deal with this problem. SDN control provides the network with centralized intelligence and enables many application such as big-data analytics to better understand and control the network. Open interfaces are critical to the SDN controller to interact with different systems. And working together with higher level service orchestration system they can deliver and maintain services in a closed-loop automation.

An end-to-end network topology consists of customer premises network, access network, aggregation network and core network from left to right. Between the OLT and core networks it is usually IP/MPLS or Ethernet networks, which overlays on top of OTN and L0 optical networks. It is now also possible that end user or OLT can connect to the OTN edge, and route directly over OTN/L0 optical networks to the core. This path is offered to customers such as business customer who demands high quality services and deterministic performance which is relatively difficult for IP/Ethernet networks. This is called the optical to cloud scenarios and is defined by the ETSI F5G working group in its architecture.

All these network segments need to work together to provide desired high-quality user experience. If they are managed in domain silos, a lot of manual operations has to be done in between, which is really inefficient. With SDN, we could use a hierarchical management and control architecture to bring these domains together.This control architecture includes SDN controllers, orchestrator, and standard, open interfaces between them. The domain controller manages a network segment with standard interfaces at both the south and northbound, connecting them to the networks as well as the E2E orchestrator at the north bound. For example, the AN controller manages the PON network with OLT, ODN and ONUs. The Aggregation network controller is for IP and OTN networks. The orchestrator cooperates with the domain controllers to provide service orchestration functions to the customer.

Now lets take a look at the control scheme for the access and IP/OTN aggregation networks. The lowest level is the domain controller, which usually manages a single network domain like an IP domain or an OTN domain. There can be multiple controllers one per domain if the network is multi-domain. These controllers are organized in a hiearchical structure with the upper layer is a hierarchical controller, or super controller. The hierarchical controller coordinate services across multiple domains including the access, IP and OTN domains. In real deployment the hierarchical controller is a logical function and can be deployed standalone or integrated with the service orchestrator. 
In this control hierarchiy, if the hierarchical controller can use the same interface to talk to the AN controller, IP controller and OTN controller, it will make it much easier to control and reduce the development and deployment complexity. Many standard organizations are working in this direction. For example, IETF proposed the ACTN control framework that covers IP and OTN with the same interface. In BBF the CloudCO initiative is developing YANG data models for access network controller and a set of Common YANG models for managing the PON devices at the southbound.
This hierarchical control together with standard interfaces enables the controllers to support the closed loop automation with end-to-end service orchestration as defined in the TMF autonomous network architecture. 

Next topic is the process in data modeling in standard organizations.

In IETF, the ACTN (Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineering (TE) Networks) is defined in RFC8453 by the TEAS WG. The ACTN framework includes a set of management and control functions used to operate one or more TE networks, to construct virtual networks that can be presented to customers and that are built from abstractions of the underlying networks. 
ACTN defines a hierarchy control architecture with three layers of controllers including the CNC (Customer Network Controller), the MDSC (Multi-Domain Service Coordinator) and the PNC (Provisioning Network Controller). A set of YANG data models is also defined in IETF, which can be used for both the MPI (MDSC-PNC Interface) and the CMI (CNC-MDSC Interface) interfaces in the ACTN architecture. 
ACTN can be used as the basic architecture for the control and management of the Optical Transport Network as well as IP networks. 

The scope of IETF ACTN is IP and transport, and so it needs to be extended or work with another access control hierarchy to cover both acess and transport. If we apply the same control hierarchy for access networks, then there is a n AN hierarchical controller and a domain controller and it is natural to think that the hierarchical controller for access and transport can be integrated for real end-to-end hierarchical control. Currently, the work for access network control is driven in the BBF CloudCO in the SDN and NFV work area. Its goal is to re-architects the broadband network using SDN and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) towards a cloud infrastructure. and its framework is defined in TR-384 and TR-411. As you can see from the left IETF ACTN and the right BBF CloudCO, they are very similar in architecture with also three hierarchical control layer built with The CloudCO architecture defines also a domain orchestrator as well as a service orchestrator. The SBI of the ACTN corresponds to both the interface between the BAA and PON devices and the interface between the CCO-DO and BAA. And the NBI of the ACTN, the MPI, corresponds to the interface between SO and DO and between DO and the access SDN MCO.

It is worth mentioning that both models defined in BBF CloudCO and IETF ACTN models are sharing the same model base and definitions, which makes it a lot easier for the integration of access and transport control. Similarly, the BBF Common YANG models at the southbound also shares similar IETF base model definitions. 

This is an overview of the architecture and YANG data models being developed in IETF, and mainly in its TEAS and CCAMP WGs. The ACTN models covers all L0-L3 networks including IP/MPLS, OTN, L0 WDM and MW. They are constructed as a few clustered model sets, including topology models, tunnel models, path computation, service models, and other models such as OAM and telemetry. These models are designed to be as compatible as possible with legacy distributed protocol-based control plane as well as with the centralized SDN control schemes. As you can see from the overall picture, most of the relevant YANG models are stable enough, are either in WG draft status as in those green boxes or as published RFCs as in those blue boxes.

The BBF CloudCO is also developing relevant data models for access networks. It defines the NBI interface SDN M&C and its functional requirements. TR-411 defines the cloudCO architecture, TR-413 defines SDN M&C interface and TR-454 defines the YANG data models for NBI. 
At the southbound, BBF is defining the abstracted device models in TR-451 for vOMCI, and OB-BAA for L2 device & service abstracted model. It also continues working on the common YANG model to advance the device models for managing physical or virtual network functions within the network.
 
Realizing end-to-end management control makes it possible to enable interesting cross-domain applications. For example, network slicing is one of the core features in 5G scenarios, which requires end-to-end slicing capabilities. IETF is developing a generic network slicing framework and YANG data models to support generic network slicing as well as technology-specific slicing such as OTN slicing. These models are provided for the NBI of the controllers for creating and maintaining network slices in IP and OTN domains, which are stiched together to form an end-to-end managed slice. 
In BBF slicing models are also being developed in the CloudCO project for NBI of SDN controllers, and in  concept of FAN sharing defined in WT-370 and WT-386 of SDN&NFV work area. It defines two types of slices, first is a resource-slice in which both the physical resources and logical resources such as MAC address pool can be sliced to serve different tenants. Second a management slice, which configures slices based on the level of authorities for different tenants. Both types of slices augment from the same model base and the right side picture shows the augmentation relationship. For more details you make check WT-370 and WT-386.

So here is the summary, ...read them out. 

Thank you.
